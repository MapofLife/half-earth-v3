# MOL API

The application uses the MOL API on the AOI page sidebar to search and show some information (name, ...) of the species and the picture. Currently we are using version 2 of the API as version 1 had some wrong pictures.

This API is used on `services/mol.js` with the locale as is available in several languages.
